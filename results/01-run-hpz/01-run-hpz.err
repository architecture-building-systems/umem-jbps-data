   ** Warning ** Version: in IDF="8.1" not the same as expected="8.2.0"
   ** Warning ** Timestep: Requested number (1) is less than the suggested minimum of 4.
   **   ~~~   ** Please see entry for Timestep in Input/Output Reference for discussion of considerations.
   ** Warning ** SetUpZoneGeometry: Entered Ceiling Height for Zone="DEFAULT_ZONE" significantly different from calculated Ceiling Height
   **   ~~~   ** SetUpZoneGeometry: Entered Ceiling Height=6.38, Calculated Ceiling Height=6.97, entered height will be used in calculations.
   ** Warning ** CheckUsedConstructions: There are 2 nominally unused constructions in input.
   **   ~~~   ** Each Unused construction is shown.

   ************* ===== Final Error Summary =====
   ************* The following error categories occurred.  Consider correcting or noting.
   ************* Nominally Unused Constructions
   ************* ..The nominally unused constructions warning is provided to alert you to potential conditions that can cause
   ************* ..extra time during simulation. Each construction is calculated by the algorithm indicated in the HeatBalanceAlgorithm
   ************* ..object. You may remove the constructions indicated (when you use the DisplayExtraWarnings option).
